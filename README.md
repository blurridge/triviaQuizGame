# Trivia Quiz Game by blurridge

## Context
Been playing recently with Python and its use of the native Tkinter module. I developed a trivia quiz game which parses random general
knowledge questions from Open Trivia DB's API upon program run. These questions are only answerable by True or False.

## How to run
You can run the program by downloading the entire repo:
```
python3 main.py
```
You need to make sure that there is an internet connection in order to let the program successfully parse questions from the OTDB API.
